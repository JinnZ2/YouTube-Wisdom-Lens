#  YouTube Wisdom Lens Prototype

**Version 0.1 – Cultural Context & Bias Detection**

A culturally-aware AI video analyzer that identifies language patterns, cultural perspective markers, semantic bias, and ethical red flags in YouTube video metadata and titles.  
Designed to support deeper understanding across worldviews, prevent unconscious bias, and surface pluralistic knowledge representations.

---

##  Core Features

- **Language Detection** using multilingual models
- **Cultural Perspective Analysis** with predefined cultural marker databases
- **Fact Similarity Scoring** using sentence embeddings across multiple knowledge domains
- **Bias & Sensitivity Alerts** including Western-centrism, sacred term misuse, and indigenous reference flags
- **Real-time YouTube Metadata Pull** using YouTube Data API v3

---

# Dependencies

Install all required packages with:


bash
pip install -q google-api-python-client transformers langdetect sentence-transformers pandas




How It Works


	1.	Fetches YouTube video metadata via video_id
 
	2.	Runs cultural context and perspective detection on the title
 
	3.	Checks semantic similarity against wisdom-domain embeddings (e.g., Taoism, Ubuntu, Western Science)
 
	4.	Flags potential cultural biases or ethical risks
	
        5.	Outputs structured results for human or downstream system review



Example:

video_id = "dQw4w9WgXcQ"  # Replace with your video ID


video_data = get_video_context(video_id)
title = video_data['items'][0]['snippet']['title']


lens = CulturalLens()
cultural_analysis = lens.analyze(title)
fact_check = verify_claim(title)
sensitivity = cultural_sensitivity_check(title)


print(pd.Series(cultural_analysis))
print(pd.Series(fact_check))
print("Sensitivity Check:", sensitivity)



Cultural Model Structure


Example cultural marker definitions:


'zh': {
  'keywords': ['道', '仁', '阴阳'],
  'perspective': 'East Asian'
}


These can be expanded to include Indigenous, Latin American, Islamic, or other traditions as needed.



Ethical Safeguards


The system includes a cultural_sensitivity_check() that detects usage of sacred or protected terms from spiritual and indigenous contexts, issuing soft alerts to prevent misuse or extraction without context.



Examples:

	•	“elder wisdom” → Indigenous term alert
 
	•	“initiation ritual” → Spiritual context alert
